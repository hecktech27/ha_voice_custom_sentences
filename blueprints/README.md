# Blueprints

## Homeassistant Motion activated light
This blueprint lets you create motion activated lights.
The following features are supported:
- You can select one or more light(s) to be turned on/off by a motion sensor.
- You can add a wait time to keep lights turned on for X seconds after the motion sensor has turned off again
- You can add an ambient light sensor and define a threshold so your lights are only turned on when it´s dark
- You can define a switch(physical or input_boolean helper) to temporarily disable this automation.
